# TPLink Plug Controller Module for PowerShell
This is a PowerShell module that can be used for controlling a TPLink HS100 or HS110 smart plug. The plug receives requests and this module sends requests on tcp port 9999, so theoretically this can traverse networks or the internet with proper port forwarding/NAT rules. However this can allow someone to control the device plugged into the TPLink plug, so do this with caution.

## Usage Instructions
1. Begin by downloading or cloning the repository to a directory of your choice. Preferably a directory in your `$env:PSModulePath` so that the module will auto-load itself when running any of the exported functions.

2. Determine the IP address of your plug using `Find-TPLinkSmartPlug`.

3. Send a command to your unit. For example we can turn on the unit.

Or Send the command using raw JSON.

*Optional*

4. `The Send-TPLinkCommand` outputs a PSCustomObject with the respose. This is generated from the raw JSON response from the plug. This response can be placed in a variable and analyzed.

Big thanks to [MaxAnderson95](https://github.com/MaxAnderson95/TPLink-PlugController-PowerShell) for making the main powershell script to get this to work.
 and
Big thanks to [EgoManiac's TPLink-PoSH](https://github.com/EgoManiac/TPlink-PoSH) for the code base for this project. My goal with this was to: cleanup the code, convert this to module format, and give myself a project.
